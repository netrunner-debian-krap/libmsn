   your option) any later version.

   On Debian systems, the complete text of the GNU General
   Public License versions 2 and 3 can be found in 
   `/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2' and

   you use this software, a newer version of the GNU GPL might have been
   published: you should check the `/usr/share/common-licenses` directory 
   and/or the Free Software Foundation website.

Since svn rev 69 (a bit after 4.0 beta 1 was released), libmsn also includes 
the following exception to allow linkage to OpenSSL:

  In addition to the license terms of the GNU General Public License,
  as copied below, the developers of libmsn give you permission
  to link the code of this release of libmsn with the OpenSSL project's
  "OpenSSL" library (or with modified versions of it that use the same
  license as the "OpenSSL" library), and distribute the linked executables.
  You must obey the GNU General Public License in all respects for all of
  the code used other than "OpenSSL". If you modify this file, you may
  extend this exception to your version of the file, but you are not
  obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception
  statement from your version.

That exception also applies to 4.0 beta 1, as stated by this e-mail from
the libmsn developer to the Debian packager:

  Yes, it was not in beta1 because I released the package before adding
  that exception.
