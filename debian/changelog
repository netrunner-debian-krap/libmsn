libmsn (4.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Bump standards to 3.8.3.0 (no changes required)
  * Add libsiren license to copyright file
  * Bump shlibs and enable LIBMSN_INBOX_URL (which breaks API and ABI)
    because ABI was broken anyway due to a method (getInboxUrl()) and data 
    member (login_time, MSPAuth, sid, kv) additions to 
    NotificationServerConnection. This happened in beta7, which I did not
    package because I was too busy at the time :-(
  * Binary packages are now libmsn0.2, libmsn0.2-dbg, etc
